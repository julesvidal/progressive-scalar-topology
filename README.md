## Examine the code

The implementation code is based on the Topology ToolKit (TTK):
https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/ . Most of the added code is
available in the archive under the src/core/base/ directory hierarchy
and consists in the following folders:
* dynamicTree
* multiresTriangulation
* persistenceDiagram
* scalarFieldCriticalPoint

Please note that persistenceDiagram and scalarFieldCriticalPoint also
contain TTK's implementations.

## Build & Install

The present build instructions have been tested onto an up-to-date
Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distribution. Other distributions may need specific
instructions.

The first step is to install the software dependencies. Copy the
following shell statement into a terminal (omit the $ character):

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y g++ cmake libvtk7-dev python3
```

This might take some time, depending on the number of already
installed packages on the target system.

Now, please clone the git repository in your working directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/julesvidal/progressive-scalar-topology.git
```

To build the proposed implementation and install it in a local
directory, please use the following commands:

```bash
$ cd progressive-scalar-topology/src
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../install ..
$ make -j$(nproc) install
```

## Fetching the data

Download the compressed archive containing the data, available at this link:

https://nuage.lip6.fr/s/qZpXrbnTbxSnYzq/download

Decompress the archive and move the resulting `data` folder into the
`progressive-scalar-topology` folder.

```bash
$ unzip data.zip
$ mv data/ progressive-scalar-topology/
```




## Reproducing the paper results

We propose to reproduce the quantitative results of the paper that
make use of our progressive method for the computation of persistence
diagrams. Scripts are provided to reproduce the comparative results of tables
2 and 3, as well as one of the figures of the paper that illustrates the
visual convergence of our persistence diagrams: figure 15.

The *data* folder contains all the datasets used in this submission.

### Tables
The *scripts* folder contains Shell and Python scripts used to generate the tables 2 and 3.

To reproduce those results, please move to the *scripts* folder and run the
benchmarks (it takes a couple hours, as results are averaged on twelve runs
each): 

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ bash benchs_pd.sh
$ bash benchs_cp.sh
```

Once the computation is done, you may run the Python scripts to generate the results, directly as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX"> tables:

```bash
$ python generateTables2and3.py
```

The TEX files *table2.tex* and *table3.tex* will be generated.

To generate a pdf file displaying the results, please compile the tex file
*tableOutputs.tex*. For instance using `pdflatex`:

``` bash
$ pdflatex tableOutputs.tex
```
It will generate the pdf file *tableOutput.pdf* containing the two tables with captions.

### Figure 15
The *scripts* folder also contains a script `fig15.sh` and a ParaView state
file `fig15.pvsm` that can be used to reproduce the visual results of figure 15.

To reproduce the results, please run the bash script:

```bash
$ bash fig15.sh
```

The results can be visualized using ParaView (https://www.paraview.org/).
Please install the corresponding package and run the paraview state file:

```bash
$ sudo apt install paraview
$ paraview --state=fig15.pvsm
```

## Using the standalone executables

The above installation has provided you with two executables files:
**ttkPersistenceDiagramCmd** and **ttkScalarFieldCriticalPointsCmd**,
available in `install/bin/`.

They can be used directly to try out our implementation of our
method. Simply entering one of those commands should list you the
needed parameters. The outputs are VTK unstructured grid files using
the '.vtu' extension.

For the progressive persistence diagram computation:

```
[CommandLine] Missing mandatory argument:
[CommandLine]   -i <{Input data-sets (*.vti, *vtu, *vtp)}>
[CommandLine]
[CommandLine] Usage:
[CommandLine]   ./ttkScalarFieldCriticalPointsCmd
[CommandLine] Argument(s):
[CommandLine]   [-d <Global debug level (default: 3)>]
[CommandLine]   [-t <Global thread number (default: 8)>]
[CommandLine]   [-P <Use progressive algo (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-F <Input scalar field identifier (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-O <Input vertex offset field identifier (default: -1)>]
[CommandLine]   [-S <start decimation (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-E <end decimation (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-I <Use Integration Tracking (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   -i <{Input data-sets (*.vti, *vtu, *vtp)}>
[CommandLine]   [-o <Output file name base (no extension) (default: `output')>]
[CommandLine] Option(s):
```

For the progressive critical points computation:

```
[CommandLine] Missing mandatory argument:
[CommandLine]   -i <{Input data-sets (*.vti, *vtu, *vtp)}>
[CommandLine]
[CommandLine] Usage:
[CommandLine]   ./ttkPersistenceDiagramCmd
[CommandLine] Argument(s):
[CommandLine]   [-d <Global debug level (default: 3)>]
[CommandLine]   [-t <Global thread number (default: 8)>]
[CommandLine]   [-F <Input scalar field identifier (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-S <starting decimation level (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-E <stopping decimation level (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-P <Use progressive algorithm (default: 0)>]
[CommandLine]   [-O <Input vertex offset field identifier (default: -1)>]
[CommandLine]   -i <{Input data-sets (*.vti, *vtu, *vtp)}>
[CommandLine]   [-o <Output file name base (no extension) (default: `output')>]
[CommandLine] Option(s):
```

A standard exemple for the progressive persistence diagram computation
with minimal verbosity is :

```bash
$ ttkPersistenceDiagramCmd -i input.vti -P 1 -S 10 -E 0 -t 1 -d 1
```

Look at the provided scripts for more examples on how to use those
commands.
